"Say Their Names" is an open source initiative started by Franck Ndame, under the #BlackLivesMatter movement. "Say Their Name" aims to make it easy to donate, raise awareness, and sign petitions under the #BlackLivesMatter movement .

This is not the official implementation by the "Say Their Name" community. This is a voluntary project made by me (Purujit Bansal) using React-Native and Expo. The motivation behind this project was to come up with a quick cross-platform solution while the talented devs at "Say Their Name" organisation are making native implementations for each platform.
